Command:
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path sample_soft.txt -Target sample_data.txt

Explanation:
I attempted to create a symbolic link to sample_data.txt. On Windows systems, creating symbolic links requires administrator privileges or developer mode. The command failed due to insufficient permissions, which demonstrates that symbolic links are handled differently from hard links.
